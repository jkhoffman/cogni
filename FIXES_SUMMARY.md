# Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Schema Validation Errors (OpenAI Structured Output)

**Issue**: OpenAI's structured output API requires:
- `additionalProperties: false` at all object levels
- ALL properties must be in the `required` array when using strict mode

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added missing `additionalProperties: false` to nested objects in `agentic_combined_example.rs`
- Modified examples to use only required fields (removed Option<T> fields) in:
  - `structured_output_derive.rs`
  - `structured_output_example.rs`

**Result**: Examples now work correctly with OpenAI's structured output API.

### 2. Wrong Model Names for Anthropic Provider

**Issue**: Examples were using OpenAI model names (e.g., "gpt-4") for all providers due to the default model being "gpt-4".

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `multi_provider.rs` to use "claude-3-haiku-20240307" for Anthropic requests
- Updated `multi_provider_tools.rs` to use proper Claude model names
- Used "llama2" for Ollama examples

**Result**: Anthropic provider now works correctly with appropriate model names.

### 3. Streaming Error Loop

**Issue**: The `client/streaming_example.rs` was entering an infinite error loop when stream errors occurred.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added `break` statement after error handling to exit the loop on error
- This prevents the infinite "Stream ended" error loop

**Result**: Streaming example now properly exits on error instead of looping indefinitely.

## Remaining Considerations

### 1. "Stream ended" Error Source
The actual "Stream ended" error still occurs initially but now properly exits. This might be:
- A transient connection issue
- An issue with the Anthropic streaming implementation
- A race condition in stream initialization

The error handling fix prevents the infinite loop, making the example usable.

### 2. OpenAI Structured Output Limitations
OpenAI's requirement that ALL fields be required is non-standard JSON Schema behavior. Consider:
- Documenting this limitation in the library docs
- Providing a utility to convert schemas to OpenAI-compatible format
- Using response validation instead of strict mode for schemas with optional fields

### 3. Anthropic Structured Output
The `structured_output_example.rs` shows an error with Anthropic not accepting `response_format`. This suggests Anthropic may not support structured output in the same way as OpenAI, which is a provider limitation rather than a bug in Cogni.
